# Introduction

A program for graphically describing the evenness of bacterial communities using
 Pareto–Lorenz (PL) curves, by plotting the cumulative relative abundance
against the cumulative proportion of each taxonomical bins (based on e.g. T-RFs
, OTUs). The more the plotted line deviates from the 1:1 line (45° diagonal),
the lower the evenness of the community.

For each sample individually, empty bins are removed and the remaining bins are
 sorted in decreasing order of relative abundance. The cumulative relative
abundance (range 0-1) and cumulative proportion of bins (range 0-1) are
calculated and the data plotted so that the first (left most) data point
represents the contribution of the bin with the highest relative abundance.
Data for all samples in the imported data set are plotted on the same graph,
to facilitate comparisons between samples.

The program also calculates the Gini-coefficient for each community, which
describes the evenness of a community as the ratio of the area between the PL
curve and the equality line and the whole triangular area above the equality
line. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect evenness) to 1 (perfect
unevenness). The reported Gini coefficient has been corrected for the number
of taxonomical units in the sample by multiplying the ratio with n/(n-1).

This implements the method described in the following papers:
